# WinningMoves-Test

Background

The purpose of this test is to create a mini project that showcases your understanding of the technologies we use at Winning Moves.
Your brief is:

for this assessment, you are required to 

•	Download the latest copy of Laravel 5.x or Symfony 2.x.

•	Create a search tool which will allow you to search for companies using the DueDil API or even the Company house API. 

•	Display the results using Angular JS 1.4.x.

•	Upload the code to GitHub or any other alternatives where we can clone the code.

This test is designed to see how you approach a development project. There is NO one correct answer, only solutions to a problem, so give it a bash.

2.	Keep a log of difficulties encountered and how you overcame them

3.	Let us know if you have used any 3rd party tools

4.	We are trying to assess your knowledge, so just submit what you can.
